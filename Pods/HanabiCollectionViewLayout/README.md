## Usage

Hanabi contains three public properties that help to customize its behavior.

```swift
@IBInspectable var standartHeight: CGFloat = 100.0
@IBInspectable var focusedHeight: CGFloat = 280.0
@IBInspectable var dragOffset: CGFloat = 180.0
```

- _standardHeight_ is the height cells should be when collapsed.  Defaults to 100
- _focusedHeight_ is the height cells should be when focused. Defaults to 280
- _dragOffset_ is the amount the user needs to scroll before the featured cell changes. Defaults to 180
